The Swift Programming Language Reference
-------------

This playground is intended to be a quick reference to the Swift language.

The code samples are taken from the [Swift Language Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-XID_454) document made available by Apple.

All sections from that doc are covered in this playground.

Use Ctrl+6 shortcut in Xcode to quickly navigate between sections.
